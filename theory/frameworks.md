# Frameworks

Security frameworks provide structured models for understanding adversary behavior and organizing defensive operations. The frameworks below are commonly used in detection engineering to prioritize coverage, map detections to real-world threats, and drive intelligence-led operations.

## The Cyber Kill Chain

Developed by Lockheed Martin, the **Cyber Kill Chain** models the stages an adversary moves through during an intrusion. Defenders can use it to identify where detections exist and where gaps remain.

| Stage | Description | Detection Opportunity |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Reconnaissance** | Adversary researches the target — scanning, OSINT, identifying attack surface | Web scanner activity, unusual DNS lookups, port scans |
| **Weaponization** | Adversary builds a deliverable payload (e.g., malicious document, exploit kit) | Typically not observable by the target organization |
| **Delivery** | Payload is transmitted to the target — phishing email, drive-by download, USB | Email gateway alerts, web proxy logs, endpoint file creation events |
| **Exploitation** | Payload executes and exploits a vulnerability | Process creation anomalies, script execution, application crashes |
| **Installation** | Adversary establishes persistence — registry keys, scheduled tasks, services | File writes to startup locations, registry modifications, new services |
| **Command & Control** | Compromised system communicates with adversary infrastructure | Unusual outbound connections, beaconing patterns, DNS tunneling |
| **Actions on Objectives** | Adversary achieves their goal — data exfiltration, destruction, lateral movement | Large data transfers, archive creation, access to sensitive systems |

### Applying the Kill Chain to Detection Engineering

- **Map existing detections** to kill chain stages to visualize where coverage is strong and where it is thin
- **Prioritize development** toward stages with the fewest detections — a common gap is between Delivery and Exploitation
- **Layer detections** across multiple stages so that if an adversary evades one, a later stage catches them

> The kill chain's linear model is a useful starting point, but real intrusions are not always sequential. Adversaries may skip stages, repeat them, or operate across multiple chains simultaneously.

## MITRE ATT&CK

<img width="577" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba854b71-5dd0-46c2-bac2-16810f9072c8" />


The **MITRE ATT&CK** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework is the industry standard for categorizing adversary behavior. It is more granular than the kill chain, organizing behaviors into **tactics** (the "why") and **techniques** (the "how").

### Structure

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Tactic** | The adversary's objective at a given stage | Execution (TA0002) |
| **Technique** | The method used to achieve the objective | Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) |
| **Sub-technique** | A specific variation of the technique | PowerShell (T1059.001) |
| **Procedure** | A real-world implementation by a specific adversary group | APT29 using encoded PowerShell commands |

### How This Repo Uses ATT&CK

Every detection rule in the `detections/` directory includes ATT&CK mappings in the TOML metadata:

```toml
[[rule.threat]]
framework = "MITRE ATT&CK"
[[rule.threat.technique]]
id = "T1059"
name = "Command and Scripting Interpreter"
reference = "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/"
[[rule.threat.technique.subtechnique]]
id = "T1059.001"
name = "PowerShell"
reference = "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/"

[rule.threat.tactic]
id = "TA0002"
name = "Execution"
reference = "https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/"
```

This mapping enables:

- **Coverage tracking** — identify which ATT&CK techniques have detections and which do not
- **Gap analysis** — prioritize detection development toward uncovered techniques relevant to your threat landscape
- **Reporting** — communicate detection maturity to stakeholders using a shared vocabulary
- **Validation** — automated scripts in `development/` verify that every detection has valid ATT&CK technique and tactic references

### ATT&CK Matrices

ATT&CK provides separate matrices for different platforms:

- **Enterprise** — Windows, macOS, Linux, Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), Network, Containers
- **Mobile** — Android, iOS
- **ICS** — Industrial Control Systems

Most detections in this repo target the Enterprise matrix, specifically Windows endpoint telemetry.

## MITRE D3FEND

**MITRE D3FEND** is a complementary knowledge base focused on defensive techniques. While ATT&CK describes adversary behavior, D3FEND describes defensive countermeasures and the artifacts they produce.

In detection engineering, D3FEND helps answer:
- **What defensive telemetry should exist** (e.g., process creation, file monitoring, network analytics)
- **Which mitigations enable stronger detections** (e.g., enabling PowerShell logging to improve visibility)
- **How to align detections to defensive outcomes** instead of only adversary actions

Pairing ATT&CK with D3FEND keeps detections grounded in what can be observed and instrumented in real environments.

## F3EAD

<img width="486" height="514" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d7239d0-4aeb-47a5-8683-9c99c8103134" />


**F3EAD** (Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, Disseminate) is an intelligence-driven operations cycle originally developed for military targeting. In security operations, it provides a framework for turning threat intelligence into detections and back into refined intelligence.

| Phase | Military Origin | Security Operations Application |
|-------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Find** | Identify the target | Identify adversary TTPs through threat intelligence or hunting |
| **Fix** | Locate the target | Determine which data sources and log events reveal the behavior |
| **Finish** | Engage the target | Build and deploy detection rules that alert on the behavior |
| **Exploit** | Gather intelligence from the engagement | Collect artifacts and context from triggered alerts and investigations |
| **Analyze** | Process gathered intelligence | Analyze incidents to understand adversary intent, tools, and infrastructure |
| **Disseminate** | Share findings | Feed findings back to threat intelligence and detection engineering teams |

### F3EAD in Practice

The F3EAD cycle connects directly to the detection engineering workflow:

1. **Find** — Threat intelligence identifies a new adversary technique targeting your industry
2. **Fix** — Research determines the technique generates Sysmon Process Create events with a distinctive command-line pattern
3. **Finish** — A detection rule is written, tested, and deployed to the production SIEM
4. **Exploit** — The detection fires on a real intrusion attempt, capturing the adversary's command-line arguments, source IP, and target systems
5. **Analyze** — Incident response investigates and discovers additional adversary infrastructure and TTPs not previously known
6. **Disseminate** — New intelligence is shared with the team, restarting the cycle with updated requirements

F3EAD is particularly useful for teams that want a tighter integration between threat intelligence and detection engineering, ensuring that intelligence outputs are always actionable and that detection outputs feed back into intelligence.

## Additional Standards Used in Modern Programs

These are commonly used alongside the frameworks above to improve portability and testability:

| Standard | Purpose | Example Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Sigma | Platform-agnostic detection rules | Translate TOML rules to a portable Sigma equivalent |
| MITRE CAR | Curated analytics patterns | Seed detection ideas and validate logic |
| DeTT&CT | Coverage assessment | Measure detection coverage against ATT&CK techniques |
| OCSF / ECS | Schema normalization | Keep detection queries portable across data sources |

## Choosing a Framework

These frameworks are complementary, not competing:

| Framework | Best For | Granularity |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Cyber Kill Chain | Visualizing detection coverage across intrusion stages | High-level (7 stages) |
| MITRE ATT&CK | Mapping detections to specific adversary behaviors | Granular (hundreds of techniques) |
| MITRE D3FEND | Mapping defensive techniques and required telemetry | Defensive technique catalog |
| F3EAD | Driving intelligence-led detection operations | Process-oriented (6 phases) |

A mature detection engineering program uses multiple lenses: the **kill chain** for strategic coverage planning, **ATT&CK** for tactical detection mapping, **D3FEND** for telemetry and defensive controls, and **F3EAD** for operational workflow between intelligence and engineering teams.

Documentation on detection engineering concepts and methodologies.

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Security Operations](security-operations.md) | Overview of SecOps functions and how detection engineering fits |

## Key Concepts

- **Detection Engineering**: The practice of designing, building, and maintaining threat detection logic
- **Detection as Code**: Treating detections as software artifacts with version control, testing, and CI/CD
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Aligning detections to adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- **Alert Tuning**: Iterative process of reducing false positives while maintaining detection coverage

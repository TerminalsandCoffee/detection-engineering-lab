# Detection Engineering Fundamentals

A comprehensive repository for creating, managing, and validating security detection rules in TOML format, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Brought to you by Terminals and Coffee.

## Overview

This repository contains custom security detection rules designed to identify malicious activity across enterprise environments. Each detection is structured in TOML format and includes metadata, query logic, risk scoring, and MITRE ATT&CK framework mappings.

Detection Engineering is a critical component of Security Operations that:
- Creates custom alerts for Incident Response teams
- Develops tests to confirm working detections & capabilities (unit, replay, and emulation-based)
- Bridges the gap between threat intelligence and actionable security monitoring

Modern detection programs also emphasize:
- **Detection-as-code** practices (versioning, CI validation, peer review)
- **Schema normalization** (ECS, OCSF, or equivalent) to keep rules portable
- **Threat emulation coverage** (Atomic Red Team, CALDERA) to validate logic
- **Telemetry quality** (field completeness, logging policy, and data drift monitoring)

## Detection Format

Each detection rule is stored as a TOML file with the following structure:

```toml
[metadata]
creation_date = "YYYY/MM/DD"

[rule]
author = ["Author Name"]
description = "Detection description"
name = "Detection Name"
risk_score = 50
severity = "medium"
type = "query"
rule_id = "unique-uuid"
query = "your detection query here"

[[rule.threat]]
framework = "MITRE ATT&CK"
[[rule.threat.technique]]
id = "T1059"
name = "Command and Scripting Interpreter"
reference = "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/"

[rule.threat.tactic]
id = "TA0002"
name = "Execution"
reference = "https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/"
```

### Detection Requirements

- Valid TOML syntax
- All required fields present
- Valid MITRE ATT&CK technique/tactic mappings
- Sub-techniques included when applicable
- Unique `rule_id` (UUID format)
- Descriptive `name` and `description`
- Appropriate `risk_score` and `severity`
- Documented data sources and assumptions (what logs/fields the rule relies on)
